# JavaPrograms
This repo consists of some of the basic java programs which i have done as part of my learning. 

## Features of Java (Java Buzzwords) :- 
 1) Object oriented 
 2) Simple 
 3) Secured 
 4) Platform Independent 
 5) Robust 
 6) Portable 
 7) Architecture Neutral 
 8) Dynamic 
 9) Interpreted 
 10) High Performance 
 11) Multithreaded 
 12) Distributed 

## Execution of a java program.
 To understand the execution of a java program. We need to be familiar with three words.
 
 ### Source Code 
 It is the code developed by the programmer 
  
 ### Object Code 
 It is the program which can be interpreted by the system.
 It contains 0's and 1's
 It is obtained by compiling the source code.

 ### Byte Code 
 Byte code is the speciality of java.After the code is compiled a byte code is generated and it does not have any relationship with the system.

Unlike other languages java doesn't convert its source to object code directly.
When we try to execute our code. The java interpreter converts the byte code into object code.

In this way a java program works similar in different operating systems 
Anyways, All the system dependencies will be taken care by the JVM(Java Virtual Machine).
